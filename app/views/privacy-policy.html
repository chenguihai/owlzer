  <h3>B. Web Beacons and Pixel Tags</h3>
  <h3>In addition to cookies, Owlzer and some third parties may also use web beacons and pixel tags on websites. A web
    beacon is usually an electronic graphic image embedded into a website or email to identify your device cookies when
    you browse the website or email. Pixel tags allow Owlzer to send emails in a way that is readable to you and find
    out whether an email is opened.</h3>
  <h3>Owlzer and some third parties use these technologies for various purposes, including analysing service usage

    called "Flash cookies") and HTML5 local storage, in certain products and services. Similar to cookies, these
    technologies store information on your device and can record some information about your activities and preferences.
    However, these technologies may use different media from cookies. Therefore, you may not be able to control them
    using standard browser tools and settings. For details about how to disable or delete information contained in Flash

  <h3>D. Do Not Track</h3>
  <h3>Many web browsers provide a Do Not Track function that can release Do Not Track requests to websites. Currently,
    major Internet standardisation organisations have not established policies to specify how websites should handle
    these requests. If you enable Do Not Track in your browser, all Owlzer websites will respect your selection.</h3>

  <h2><strong>IV. How Owlzer Protects Your Personal Data</strong></h2>
  <h3>Owlzer attaches great importance to the security of your personal data and has adopted standard industry practices
    to protect your personal data and prevent it from unauthorised access, disclosure, use, modification, damage, or
    loss. To this end, Owlzer takes the following measures:</h3>
  <h3>(1) We take reasonable and feasible measures to ensure that the personal data collected is minimal and relevant to
    what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed. We retain your personal data for no
    longer than is necessary for the purposes stated in this Statement and privacy notice of specific product or
    service, unless extending the retention period is required or permitted by law.<br/>
    (2) We use a range of technologies such as cryptographic technologies to ensure the confidentiality of data in
    transmission. We implement trusted protection mechanisms to protect data and data storage servers from attacks.<br/>
    (3) We deploy access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorised personnel can access your personal data. In
    addition, we control the number of authorised personnel and implement hierarchical permission management on them
    based on service requirements and personnel levels.<br/>
    (4) We strictly select business partners and service providers and incorporate personal data protection requirements
    into commercial contracts, audits, and appraisal activities.<br/>
    (5) We hold security and privacy protection training courses, tests, and publicity activities to raise employees'
    personal data protection awareness.<br/>
  </h3>
  <h3>Owlzer is committed to protecting your personal data. Nevertheless, no security measure is perfect and no product,
    service, website, data transfer, computing system, or network connection is absolutely secure.</h3>
  <h3>To cope with possible risks, such as personal data leakage, damage, and loss, Owlzer has developed several
    mechanisms and control measures, clearly defined the rating standards of security incidents and vulnerabilities and
    corresponding processing procedures. Owlzer has established a dedicated emergency response team to implement
    security planning, loss reduction, analysis, locating, and remediation, and to perform tracking operations with
    related departments based on security incident handling regulations and requirements.</h3>
  <h3>If any personal data incident occurs, Owlzer will notify you, pursuant to relevant legal and regulatory
    requirements, of the basic information about the security incident and its possible impact, measures that Owlzer has
    taken or will take, suggestions about active defense and risk mitigation, and remedial measures. The notification
    may take the form of an email, text message, push notification, etc. If it is difficult to notify data subjects one
    by one, we will take appropriate and effective measures to release a Security Notice. In addition, we will also
    report the handling status of personal data security incidents as required by supervisory authorities.</h3>
